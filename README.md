# Spotify Top 100 (2000-2023) EDA Project

Here are the questions that being analyzed:
* What are the top 10 genres?
* Who are the top 15 most popular musical artists?
* How many songs are in top 100 from 2000 to 2023?

  * What year(s) are they the most popular musically?
  * Explore songs' characteristics for each of the three artists.
